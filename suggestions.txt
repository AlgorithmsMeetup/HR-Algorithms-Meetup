Hey Evan, this is Nicholas. I've been to a few of the meetups, and while they're great, I think that they can be more streamlined. 

At the last meetup, the hardest thing for me was to explain to everyone what the algorithm should be doing, and how I knew it wasn't doing that. I was also writing quick console.log tests in order to prove things, and that's always dumb.

This past week I finished one of my Hack Reactor precourse materials, which is writing a basic underscore clone called 'underbar.' One of the cool things about it was that it was written to use a lot of Mocha BDD tests to make it easy to know what your program was NOT doing correctly, as well as what it SHOULD have been doing. Wow that was a horrible sentence.

I think that if the whole group wrote tests together, it would be much easier for us to understand and then write the algorithms in our smaller groups.

Similarly, I think that putting everything onto Github would help things be very streamlined. My last group had people using REPL.it, codecademy, Node in terminal, and a few other javascript environments, all at once. If each meetup was a new branch, we could just pull that branch and work on the algorithm, then submit a pull request. This would also help us find the solutions later (gists are terrible.)

I'm sorry that this is so poorly written out, it's 12:30 am and I'm just so excited that I want to send you this right now!

P.S. Thank you for hosting these meetups. They're a lot of fun for me and they make waiting to go to HR a tiny bit easier :D
