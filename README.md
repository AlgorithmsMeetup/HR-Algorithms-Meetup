HR-Algorithms-Meetup
====================

The Unofficial Github Repository for Hack Reactor's algorithms meetup.

The HRAM is a biweekly event where amateur programmers visit Hack Reactor to practice solving interesting algorithms. 

This is a highly interactive and supportive group dedicated to exploring our understanding of Javascript and different algorithm concepts. We welcome all levels of JS experience!

A possible meetup format is as follows:

8:00 Meetup Starts, People settle in
8:05 Personal Introductions
8:10 Problem Introduction & Clarification
8:15-8:30 The whole group cooperate to write BDD Tests, Greg pushes
8:30 People break into smaller groups to create solutions
8:35-9:40 Groups hack on solutions to make all the tests pass. Push. Code.
9:40-10:00 Algorithm Presentations, Biweekly Branch Merges

How to find us:
Tell the doorman you are here for Hack Reactor and then come up to the 8th(top) floor!

This week's Algorithm is pretty simple. It just creates a shallow copy (a 'clone') of an object (this includes arrays).
